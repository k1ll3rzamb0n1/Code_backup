INSTALL PERL JSON AND JSON::SX modules in order to reproduce functionality

cd to xampp/perl/bin

type:
	PPM install JSON
	yes to if you really want to install it
	PPM install JSON::XS
	yes again

done with extra work

I tested page under google chrome and firefox. Not sure of protability to IE -> IE is lame



Also under database creation need add two new users. 

One with read only access and one with read/write priviledges to the database

add user: bsadmin  -> all priviledges on bookstore db
password: toor     

add user: bsuser   -> select priveledges on bookstore db
password; password




modify the buildDB.sql and popDB.sql scripts to point to the location of the rest of the sql files and you will be able to build and populate the database with all test information
