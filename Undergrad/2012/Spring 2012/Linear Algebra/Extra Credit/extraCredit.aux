It appears that the eigenvalues are converging to zero in the same manner as a dying exponential, like a decaying function. After looking closely at different numbers of plotted eigen vectors i have noticed that after about nine or ten eigen vectors the rest are so close together that there is very little difference. Also the values are very small and there fore more susceptible to small amounts of noise. It appears that we could approximate our f with far fewer eigenvectors than N. And hence 10 eigenvectors which make the biggest difference could be used to approximate f in equation 2. Later we do this approximation for 9.}}{4}}
